You've another instance of Tomcat 
already running. You can confirm this by going to
http://localhost:8080 in your webbrowser and check if you get the Tomcat default home page or a
Tomcat-specific 404 error page. Both are equally valid evidence that Tomcat runs fine; if it didn't,
then you would have gotten a browser specific HTTP connection timeout error message.

You need to shutdown it. Go to /bin subfolder of the Tomcat installation folder and execute 
the shutdown.bat (Windows) or shutdown.sh (Unix) script. If in vain, close Eclipse and then 
open the task manager and kill all java and/or javaw processes. Or if you actually installed 
it as a Windows service for some reason (this is namely intented for production and is unhelpful when you're just developing), 
open the services manager (Start > Run > services.msc) and stop the Tomcat service. If necessary, 
uninstall the Windows service altogether.
For development, just the ZIP file is sufficient.
